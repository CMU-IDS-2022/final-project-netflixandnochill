Short (~250 words) abstract of the concrete data science problem and how the solutions addresses the problem.

## Introduction
VARIETY . ACCESSIBILITY . DOLLARS

The main points of focus for OTT Platforms is to provide a wide variety of content to their viewers which is easily accessible to them at a price that binds the former two. To stay relevant and rule the market, platforms need to understand viewers' choice of the content they would prefer to watch and relish. The viewership through the internet is rising through OTT Platforms, and now is the time for these platforms to reach the right set of audience based on their changing interests. The main problem that we are trying to solve here is “What kind of content streaming platforms need to produce to stay relevant around the world”.
 With the current hit of the pandemic we can say that recreation too has moved online. The wide variety in content and accessibility has resulted in a higher retention rate on OTT media applications. This major shift has increased competition between these mega platforms and the disruption of content production pipelines is also another aspect that needs to be addressed. Amidst these changing times, OTT platforms are definitely tackling how they can connect with a wider audience and retain that base of viewership. OTT platforms aim to grow their base aggressively and as a solution are divulging into their own productions to create content with a wider reach. This aspect is our major motivation behind trying to solve this problem. We aim to provide these platforms with some insights like what kind of content is being produced in each country and how well it's working for them and what genre has a wider reach and viewership. We have also developed a movie recommendation system to analyze the network around the list of movies recommended. This analysis will help us get a better understanding of what genres are linked through recommendation and how we can use content popularity in defining a niche for a particular OTT platform using which they can differentiate themselves in the market.
